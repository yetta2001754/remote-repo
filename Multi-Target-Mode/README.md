# BullseyePolytopePosioning - Multi-Target Mode
Similar to single-target mode, you can use the scripts provided in `launch/` and `analysis/` in order to launch the experiments in multi-target mode.

The results for multi-target mode can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13p24HnylrDLPIv3EHv7VGvwJgbqqctSg/view?usp=sharing).
